## How to play?
  This game is console-based. Thus, I recommend opening it from a console.
  Run it with `python3 app.py`
  
  The menu is now displayed!
  
  You can:
    
  1. Start playing with default settings
  2. Choose the words language
  
     - There's currently only French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· and English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
  3. Choose the words source
  
     - Every language have a small list of words in settings.json
    
     - French currently have an option to get a random word from a website
    
        - TODO: Find and implement this for ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
  
  4. Custom few game rules
  
     - Any new rule customization is welcome! Either suggests in an issue or fork & PR!
